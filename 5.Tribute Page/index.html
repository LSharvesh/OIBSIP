      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, known as the “Missile Man of India,” 
        was an Indian aerospace scientist and the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. 
        He played a pivotal role in India’s Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, establishing India 
        as a nuclear power. Born in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he rose from humble beginnings 
        to become one of the most respected scientists and leaders in the world.
      </p>

        Dr. Kalam’s contributions to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the 
        Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) were monumental. He inspired 
        millions of youth with his vision of a developed India, emphasizing the power of education, 
        innovation, and integrity.

        Even after his presidency, he continued to reach out to students, motivating them 
        to dream big and work hard. He passed away doing what he loved most — delivering 
        a lecture to students at IIM Shillong, leaving behind a legacy of humility, 
        brilliance, and patriotism.
